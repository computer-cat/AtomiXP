# AtomiXP &nbsp; [![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/computer-cat/atomixp/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/computer-cat/atomixp/actions/workflows/build.yml)

AtomiXP is an experimental ublue image with XFCE and the latest build of xfce-winxp-tc prebuilt. Primarily made for personal use, but you're welcome to try it. Expect bugs and X11 related issues.

## Features

- [x] Full XP desktop, taskbar, and greeter experience out of the box (wintc-desktop disabled OOTB for better functionality, can be re-enabled by removing .disabled from the autostart entry)
- [x] Automatic theme configuring for new and existing users rebasing from another image (unverified atm, may be broken)
- [x] Steam and Bazaar flatpaks included
- [x] Nvidia Support (atomixp-nvidia-open)
- [ ] ISO Downloads (coming soontm)
- [ ] Wayland support via labwc? (maybe)

## Installation

> [!WARNING]  
> [This is an experimental feature](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable), try at your own discretion.

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/computer-cat/atomixp:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/computer-cat/atomixp:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

For nvidia cards, use "atomixp-nvidia-open:latest" in place of atomixp:latest

## Additional info

If you prefer to use the built in XFCE panel rather than the WinTC one, disable the autostart entry for wintc-taskband. RedmondXP has been included as well if you want to keep the XP look with the original panel.
